Even so, those in western states need to investigate their relationship to fires. One clear takeaway is that the understanding of a wildfire as a natural phenomenon needs to be challenged. Fires are seldom the result of natural causes. We must develop the public perception of wildfires to a place where everyone understands that every fire has a cause and that cause is almost always human activity. Beyond that, the causes of fire mortality can be used as a priority list for developing a new public perception and identifying immediate paths for improvement.</p><p>The items which must be addressed to reduce fire mortality are relatively straightforward. The ability to name the causes of fires enables us to address the issues in a straightforward manner. This is an important development away from the understanding of wildfires as a natural phenomenon akin to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or hurricanes. Naming the causes of fires as they are determined will be powerful in identifying the destructive event with its cause – specific human activity.</p><p>Thankfully, the narrative is moving away from apocalyptic. This is exemplified in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric’s fallout from recent fires in California. This year’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/07/785775074/pg-e-announces-13-5-billion-settlement-of-claims-linked-to-california-wildfires?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=nprnews">$13.5 billion settlement</a>, though not legally placing liability on PG&amp;E, does begin to re-craft the narrative surrounding fires. The public perception of recent fires places the blame squarely on utilities companies which have failed to adequately maintain their lines and surrounding vegetation. With the PG&amp;E settlement, the public discourse is beginning to shift to an understanding that the recent fires are not natural phenomena but rather the byproduct of human activity. We are responsible for the recent devastation.</p><p>This project has produced three practical recommendations and one linguistic shift. The three leading causes of fire mortality can be addressed immediately. First, continued public health education efforts towards the societal cessation of smoking will immediately reduce preventable fire deaths. Second, interventions in terms of legislation or best practices need to be implemented . The levels of death caused by electrical and equipment malfunction are unacceptable and the responsible parties must be made responsible. Finally, we must expand existing childhood fire education programs to include adults. There are strong curricula in place for children regarding forest fires. However, adults need to be made aware of the realities of how fires are likely to occur and how they can avoid these situations. This should help avoid the huge number of unintentional fires. In that vein, we also need to break down the division between forest fires, wildfires, and urban fires.</p><p>I recommend a change of terminology – reserve the term wildfire for only those rural fires which are determined to have <em>natural </em>causes. The division of urban fires and wildfires is no longer a useful framework. Catastrophic urban fires are not a common occurrence. Modern firefighting techniques and building standards have proved excellent at limiting the spread of fires as they occur in urban spaces. Within the connotations of the current framework, urban fires are seen to be human fires and wildfires are seen to be natural fires. This misunderstanding of the causes of fire is problematic. The recent destruction in the cities of Paradise and Santa Rosa, California are examples of human caused <i>wildfires</i> encroaching on cities. The distinction between wildfires and urban fires is no longer meaningful and only serves to obscure the nature of fires with origins outside urban spaces. Further, the term <em>wild</em> carries connotations of the natural – a notion clearly refuted in the US Fire Administration dataset. In its place, we might consider using terms such as human fire, anthropogenic fire, or more specifically identify each type of fire by its direct cause.</p><p>My brush with catastrophe in rural Northern California exemplifies the narrative of this project. I identified signs of fire and chose to ignore them. A human system – the water pump – failed and created a small electrical fire. A confluence of failure of human systems and insufficient fire education created a situation which might have turned explosive. For me, the understanding that catastrophic fires which damage human spaces are human generated actually greatly diminished my fear and anxiety. The notion of <i>natural</i> fire – a random, catastrophic event – was far more scary than a damaged power line causing a fire. The project helped realize that the notion of a catastrophic natural fire is largely mythic. True <i>wildfires</i> are infrequent and rarely harm humans. To identify myself, my kind, and the systems I live in as the cause of my fear brought my anxiety out of the dark and literally gave it a human face. Identifying and normalizing the human causes of these events will be instrumental in holding offending parties accountable. Further, the recognition of our volitional relationship to fire can undo the damage done to our fire prevention efforts. If we acknowledge we are the cause of the fires, it gives us agency to begin undoing the systems which produce fires.</p><p><strong>Outstanding Questions</strong></p><p>This project has prompted a great deal of ongoing inquiry. A dataset or series of datasets can only capture a particular sliver of reality. The introduction of further datasets representing separate slivers, expert interviews, and research on public perception of fires would provide valuable context, support, and perhaps counter-narrative to the narrative presented here.</p><p>1. Have the fires, although decreasing in number, become more explosive and dangerous as time goes on?</p><p>2. Are wildfires which damage residences on the rise?</p><p>3. How do changes in human development patterns affect fire trends? In particular, does the development of exurbs and sprawl in California correlate to an increase in property damage?</p><p>4. Is there a more granular dataset which breaks down fire damage by state? Can we look at the frequency and intensity of fires in the Western States over time?</p><p>5. Do the fire trends observed in the United States extend to the rest of North America? Does Northern Mexico exhibit a similar fire profile to the American southwest and does the band of western fires extend through Oregon and Idaho into Central Canada?</p><p>6. Are there datasets which look at the same measures but go further back in time? The dataset I used dates back to 2003 but US Fire Administration also has other datasets dating back to 2000. It is worth further inquiry to discover what historical data is available to take a zoomed out view of the situation. The trends over a decade are encouraging but may obscure a larger narrative, more in line with assumptions that climate change is fueling devastating wildfires, that fires are on the rise. The short time frame of this dataset allows the analysis of short term trends. It likely fails to allow for the prediction of cyclical fire patterns which may be more useful in understanding the effects of wildfire </p><p><a href="https://qjwoods.github.io/dhFoF/test3.html">Continue to About</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://qjwoods.github.io/dhFoF/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
